# Purpose

This repository holds useful high-level widgets written in pure python.  
This library used type hints and requires Python 3.5+; it could, however, be back-ported to earlier Python versions without difficulty.

For more details, check out the [documentation](https://tk-tools.readthedocs.io).

Here are some examples screenshots of the widgets you can create:

# Testing

Basic testing has been instantiated *however* it is currently limited.  To execute style testing:

    flake8 tk_tools
    
To execute automated tests:

    py.test test.py
    
More testing will be added to new widgets as they are brought online while further testing will be added to old widgets as the project matures.
