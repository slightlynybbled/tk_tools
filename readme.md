# Purpose

This repository holds useful high-level widgets written in pure python.  
This library used type hints and requires Python 3.11+; it could, however, be back-ported to earlier Python versions without difficulty.

For more details, check out the [documentation](https://tk-tools.readthedocs.io).

Here are some examples screenshots of the widgets you can create:
